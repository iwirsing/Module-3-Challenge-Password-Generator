## <u>Webpage Features</u>

- The user can choose the password length from 8 to 128. If a number outside the range is chosen or a letter is typed in, an error will be printed in the password area and the process stops.

- The user will be prompted for the character types to be included in the password. Every response will be added into an object and will confirmed to the user. At the end of the selection, the program will validate to make sure at least one character type is chosen. If none is chosen, an error will be printed in the password area and the process stops.

- The object with the validated user selection will be sent to generate a password. The password will then be printed.

- The user can copy the password into the clipboard for convenience. The webpage will then alert that the password has been copied.
